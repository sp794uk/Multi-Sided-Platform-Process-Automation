Proof of concept implementation and end-to-end system architecture for automated processing of multi-format-invoice data from vendors and 3rd party contractors.

# Supported Data Formats: 
PDF, HTML, Spreadsheets (direct or via API), Image, hard copy etc. formats for text.
Note: To incorporate data from hard-copy-text in our process, either it should be received in digital format (i.e. JPEG/Pdf etc.) from the source or otherwise be converted in-house to digital format.

# Challenges:
- Inconsistent Invoices: Multiple template versions (i.e. changing identifier-value pair): Must programatically fix in the implimentation using Pandas unless consistent format per vendor is enforced.
- Supporting both API-driven and traditional manual data collection processes: web app supporting direct data-file upload (Invoices, spreadsheets etc.) via web rather than collecting files over email. This should significantly reduce operational load.

# Flow:
1. Web-based (inbound) Data Collection from Vendors.
2. Web-based (inbound) Data Collection from 3rd-party Contractors.
3. Automatic Processing of Data Files (AWS API / Open-Source Python based lib).
4. Processing of hard-copy-files (i.e. invoices from 3rd party contractors; either at source & uploaded or in-house manual digitization).
5. Automatic Insights/Dashboard: with click of a button (on demand) Notes, Customer Invoices, and Red-flags-report highlighting mismatches between manual data and digital invoices etc. can be generated by the concerned operator.

Note: Steps 4 & 5 incorporates 'Human-in-the-loop' approach.

# Tools:
- AWS (API)
- OpenSource Python lib
- Power BI
